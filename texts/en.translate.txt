The sail of lonely is whitening
In the fog of the sea! ..
What is he looking for in a distant country?
What did he throw in the edge of his own? ..

Waves play - the wind is fading,
And the mast is bending and hidden ...
Alas! He is not looking for happiness
And he does not run from happiness!

Under it, a jet of light azure,
Above it the ray of the sun is golden ...
And he, rebellious, asks the storm,
As if in storms there is peace!
